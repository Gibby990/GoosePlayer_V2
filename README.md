Howdy


This is is an MP3 Player that can be used for a variety of things. 
I'm mostly just tired of going through 20 Youtube tabs while DMing so this is my solution.

I call this version 2 because I did most of the structure without Maven and when I needed to add Maven 
packages because java does not have good audio handling implementation.

I could not add Maven functionality to the old project 
so this is a new Maven project with the old code.

Make sure to install Java first
