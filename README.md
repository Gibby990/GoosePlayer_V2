This is is an MP3 Player that can be used for a variety of things. 
I'm mostly just tired of going through 20 Youtube tabs while DMing so this is my solution.
Originally started when I was practicing data structures and recursion for college and snowballed into this.

I call this version 2 because I did most of the structure without Maven and when I needed to add Maven 
packages because java does not have good audio handling implementation.

Make sure to install Java first
