Howdy


This is is an MP3 Player (or what will be) that can be used for a variety of things. 
I'm mostly just tired of going through 20 Youtube tabs while DMing so this is my solution.

I call this verion 2 because I did most of the structure without Maven and when I needed to add a Maven package
I could not add Maven functionality so this is a new Maven project with the old code.

Please do not let this version reflect the final product or what the final product will look like.
Java is a pain and implementing many things at once without major bugs is neigh impossible.
I will add more features later on and make it not look like a program from the early 2000's.
