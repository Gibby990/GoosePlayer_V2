/* Report for 9/8

 * Features:
 * Created "Clear" Function for MonoPlayer
 * Made player pause/unpause when moving slider.
 * 
 * Bug Fixes:
 * load song pauses the sampleplayer 
 * removed all previous connections before calling a new sampleplayer in play.
 * Fixed rubber banding when moving time on the slider
 * Made player display song time when song is queued, instead of when the song is played.
 * 
 * Code Cleanup:
 *  MusicPlayer.java
 *      Removed unused imports
 *      Trimmed debugging sys logs (Mostly time related ones)
 *      Removed the following beads components as the audio was going straight to ac.out, leaving these default eq settings unused
 *          Gain, BiquadFilter, highPass/lowPass Compressor, Limiter
 *          I dont think ill readd this feature, it would be if someone wanted to define thier own EQ in the program which I dont see happening
 *      Removed n variable that was used to identify a player for debug logs. I never used it and took up code space.
 *      Removed newValue variable.
 *
